# New in Grow a Garden

## The Beanstalk Quest
A new quest where players must harvest crops—including *Prickly Plants*—to raise a giant Beanstalk. They deliver the required crops to vendors located in the center of the map.

## What are Prickly Plants?
Prickly Plants are those that bear prickles or thorns—whether on the plant itself or on its fruit, making them distinct in the *Grow a Garden* game world.

This is especially helpful for new players who may not immediately recognize which plants qualify as Prickly Plants.
